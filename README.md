# ImageKleaner

When you take a picture, you capture more than just an image. Smartphones and digital cameras embed additional data within the picture file, known as EXIF metadata. This metadata includes information such as:

- Make and model of the device used to take the photo
- Dimensions and pixel density of the photo
- Camera settings (zoom, aperture, flash, etc.)
- Date, time, and location where the photo was taken
- Orientation of the device
- Altitude and speed of the photographer
- Copyright information

However, this metadata can pose privacy and security risks. This simple tool can be used to remove any EXIF metadata from png, jpg and jpeg images.
